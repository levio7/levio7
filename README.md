# Hello folks <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="50px">,   I am Raz Levi 

##  üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About Me:

- :computer: I'm currently Computer Science Student
- :rocket: Always ready to collaborate for Dev Experiments
- :dart: Life Hack: "The better we get at getting better, the faster we will get better" 
- :zap: Fun fact: I am  a Tennis player

I am an ambitious, passionate, and autodidact software developer. I love diving into details, which means analyzing whatever I am dealing with to find root causes and underlying meanings. Ever since I was a little kid, computers and computer software have been my passion. I went through numerous books on anything related to software engineering and development, I was insatiable, and this passion led me to pursue a Computer Science education, and I do that with the same fascination and passion that drove me as a kid. I am obsessed with the idea of developing software to solve practical problems, and I strive to stand on the vanguard of technology and innovate immersive digital experiences that make life better. To me, software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am genuinely passionate in solving. I believe that software development can transform and improve people's lives worldwide, and I am excited that I have the opportunity to make an impact and take part in it, this journey made me truly realize how much there is yet to learn and create, and I am grateful and excited about it.

I am a lifelong learner with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and I love to be in a constant state of learning and improving. Furthermore, I have a never-ending desire to create beautiful and powerful things, and the ability to share them with the world drives me to continue developing and growing. I enjoy both front-end for creating practical, functional, and enjoyable user experiences and back-end for building scalable and clean software. In addition, trying to solve challenging engineering and architectural problems is pleasant for me.
